# note-taker
an application that lets user keep track of notes and take notes

## Description

This web application is a note taker that lets user create a new note by giving it a title and a text description. Users are then able to save the note and have it store in it's database that we have in JSON. Users are able to write and save multiple notes. Once a task or note is no longer needed the users are able to delete that note as well. 

What I learned from this project is the use of express.js and the use of routers. I also learned to use heroku to deploy the application to a live server. I learned to use express.js to listen to ports and routing pages to specific html files or for them to return json data. 

## Installation

After cloning all the files from the respository you would need to install a few packages to be able to run this application. You would need node.js, express.js, and generate-unique-id. With the included package.json file in the repository you would only need to run "npm install" after installing node.js into your local machine. 

## Usage
- install node.js
- install express.js
- install generate-unique-id
- run index.js in the root folder
- go to your localport:3000 to run the application in your local computer.
- open to the landing page and navigate to the notes page.
- enter a title and text description for your new note and hit save at the top right corner
- click on the note that was just saved on the left column to preview the note
- click on the trash can icon to delete the note
